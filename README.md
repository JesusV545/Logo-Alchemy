# Logo-Alchemy

## Description
This application uses node.js and OOP to create a simple logo with the users choice of text, text color, shape, and shape color. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this application was to implement the usage of node.js, testing with 'jest', inquirer, and object oriented programming and allow the user to create an SVG logo through the command terminal. In addition, the user is able to run tests with the code using the command "node shapes.test.js" in the terminal to ensure the code is working properly. Created SVG logos are then saved onto the 'examples' folder.

## How to use
Once the code is loaded, simply open up the intergrated terminal and install inquirer and jest with the command "npm i". This will install the required dependencies in order for the code to run properly. After that, simply type "node index.js". Then, answer the prompted questions and admire your new svg logo in the 'examples' folder.
